	<h4>01 Dance With Whale Sharks</h4>
	<p>Arrive at La Paz, and don your professional wetsuit and snorkeling gear. Sail over the shimmering surface of the Sea of Cortez until you reach the natural habitat of the whale sharks. It won’t be hard to spot the enormous animals, whose size compares directly to a yellow school bus; however, don’t fear the 40-foot (12-meter) stature as whale sharks are considered the sea’s most gentle giants. Submerge yourself in the warm water with a supervised guide, and then marvel at the whale shark’s agile elegance in spite of their size. Follow the direction of your guide as you swim the waters near the natural habitat. Climb back on board for a refreshing rest and observe the water for manta rays, dolphins, and even humpback whales.</p>
	<h4>02 Roam on Camels</h4>
	<p>Escape the tourist crowds as you venture deep into the scenic countryside to Rancho San Cristobal, an idyllic oceanfront ranch. Listen as your guide regales you with tales of Mexico’s colorful culture and history, admiring the cactus-lined roads and unique ambience of the surroundings. On arrival at the ranch, gain insight into the Baja peninsula’s ecology as you enjoy a scenic stroll on a coastal trail. Climb atop an awaiting camel to admire the seaside scenery from a unique vantage point; venture over the soft sand’s on a 20-minute beach safari atop your camel.</p>
	 <h4>03 Advanture By ATV</h4>
	<p>You’ll be taken to G-Force Adventures Park where you can visit the rare White Lions and pick your Double Seat Independent Suspension luxury ATV. The ATV is fully automatic, has hydraulic brakes, and independent suspension for an amazing ride.
  You will receive all equipment including a helmet, goggles and all the instructions you need to begin your great Cabo ATV tour. Your expert guide will escort you deep into the desert, taking you through the narrow riverbeds. You will drive through canyons, sand creeks, and mountains with a breathless view of the Pacific Ocean. You may even have the chance of viewing migrating whales. Finally, you’ll reach beautiful Margaritas Beach in Cabo San Lucas.</p>
	<h4>04 Visit Hotel California</h4>
	<p>Venture to the stylish Malecon, a blissful beachfront boardwalk, to pleasure your palate with crunchy tacos, refreshing soft drinks, and tangy tequila. Revitalized, stroll and enjoy the bespoke boutiques of the beach before setting out to explore the traditional town of Todos Santos. Visit the popular Hotel California, famed for its potential inspiration of the Eagle’s classic hit, and then return to your minivan for the relaxing journey back to Los Cabos.</p>
